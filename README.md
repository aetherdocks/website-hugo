## Some features

- Multilingual support
- Simple dark/light mode (technically supports as many modes as you want)
- Cool parallax background made with no JS, only CSS and 2 SVGs

This is supposed to be for *MY* personal use, so don't expect much support on using this repo for yourself. If you want something similar. I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It can be simple, or as complex as you want to set it up.
